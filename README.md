javautils
=========

a simple collection of javautils i wrote that have come in handy

* resteasy - chainable pattern for making rest calls compatable with stack3.2/spring3.1/httpclient4
  - ignore bad/self-signed ssl certs
  - supports basic auth
  - easily attach files to a POST, PUT
  - easily parsed into XML, JSON, etc. 
* reasteasy-legacy - a resteasy implementation compatible with stack3.1/spring3.0/httpclient3
